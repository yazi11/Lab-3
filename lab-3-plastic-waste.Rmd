## Data

The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file in the `data` folder of your repository.
You can read it in using the following.

```{r load-data, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```


**Hint:** If you're not sure, run the command `?NA` which will lead you to the documentation.


-   Have a quick look at the data and notice that there are cells taking the value `NA` -- what does this mean?

# Exercises

Let's start by taking a look at the distribution of plastic waste per capita in 2010.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-hist, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

One country stands out as an unusual observation at the top of the distribution.
One way of identifying this country is to filter the data for countries where plastic waste per capita is greater than 3.5 kg/person.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-max, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```

Did you expect this result?
You might consider doing some research on Trinidad and Tobago to see why plastic waste per capita is so high there, or whether this is a data error.

E1.  Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent. What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita?
```{r }
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
      mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                    color = continent, 
                    fill = continent)) +
   geom_histogram(alpha = 0.7)
```
Answer1: the africa is the most density continent and outh america is the most conttinent in plastic watse per cap.

**NOTE:** From this point onwards the plots and the output of the code are not displayed in the lab instructions, but you can and should write the code and view the results yourself.


Another way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_density()
```

And compare distributions across continents by colouring density curves by continent.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let's also fill the curves in with colours as well.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```



```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill-alpha}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

This still doesn't look great...

E2.  Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.
```{r }
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
      mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                    color = continent, 
                    fill = continent)) +
   geom_density(alpha = 0.4)
```

E3.  Describe why we defined the `color` and `fill` of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the `alpha` level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.

Answer here:Because here we represent a set of data (continents),not just color control,as the colors here belong to the continents,and also the filling is related to the continents But the Alpha it's talking about all Graphic(gemo_density)

And yet another way to visualize this relationship is using side-by-side box plots.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-box}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

E4.  Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to [violin plots](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html). What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?
```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-box}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin()
```
Answer:box plots provide a coarser summary of the data,provide more of a summary of a distribution can also be seen as an advantage in certain cases,also the point in the graph or mapping it's most clearly then violi phots.

**Remember:** We use `geom_point()` to make scatterplots.


E5.  Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita using a scatterplot.
    Describe the relationship.
    
```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-scatter}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_point()
```
Answer:the relationship is positive.

E6.  Colour the points in the scatterplot by continent.
    Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated?
    
```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-scatter-by-continent}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
mapping = aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,color = continent, fill = continent,
        y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
geom_point()

```
Answer: Eurpoe (positive) relationship , Africa is the most (mismanged _ plastic watse per cap )


E7.  Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic waste per capita and coastal population.
    You will need to make two separate plots.
    Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated?

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap_total_population}

```

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap_coastal_population}

```

# Wrapping up

If you haven't had time to finish the exercises above, please ask for help before you leave!


**Hint:** The x-axis is a calculated variable. One country with plastic waste per capita over 3 kg/day has been filtered out. And the data are not only represented with points on the plot but also a smooth curve. The term "smooth" should help you [pick which geom to use](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-geoms).


E8.  Recreate the following plot, and interpret what you see in context of the data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
plastic_waste %>% 
  mutate(coastal_pop_prop = coastal_pop / total_pop) %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = coastal_pop_prop, y = plastic_waste_per_cap, color = continent)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(color = "black") +
    scale_color_viridis_d() +
    labs(x = "Coastal population proportion (Coastal / total population)", 
         y = "Plastic waste per capita ", 
         color = "Continent",
         title = "Plastic waste vs. coastal population proportion",
         subtitle = "by continent") +
    theme_minimal()
```
